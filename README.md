# AirportSimulation
The primary objective of the simulation model is to optimize the staffing levels and service process at border control to minimize passenger waiting times while ensuring efficient use of resources
A hybrid DES/ABM model for airport border control model is developed, by integrating two different modelling approaches, discrete event simulation (DES) and agent based modelling (ABM). The DES part of the model will simulate the physical processes and the flow of passengers through the different checkpoints, such as security screening, immigration checks, baggage claim and customs. The DES will model the queuing of passengers at each checkpoint and the allocation of staff resources to the checkpoints. The DES component will

use arrival rates, processing times and delays (waiting time) to estimate passenger waiting times and staff utilization rates.
The ABM part of the model will simulate the behaviour of individual passengers, including their waiting time, time in service and others. To integrate the DES and ABM components, we will use a hybrid approach where the agents in the ABM component will interact with the DES component, and the DES component will update the state of the agents in the ABM component. This will allow the model to simulate the interactions between individual passengers and the physical processes at the different checkpoints.
To implement the model in Any Logic, we can create agent types for passengers and staff. We also create discrete--event blocks along with resource pools for each step in the border control process, such as passport control, security check and customs, with parameters for processing times and staff requirements. The simulation can run for a period of 10 days, with output variables such as average passenger waiting times, staff utilization rates, and the impact of the smart app on passenger distribution. The model uses moderate amount of Java code only for initialization and for calculating variables and parameters. Both 3D and 2D GUI along with view navigation is build using the libraries for easy understanding of the model.
